An automated **Student Attendance Management System** built using **Python, OpenCV, Flask, and QR Code Technology**. The system generates unique QR codes for students from a class-wise or subject-wise student list, scans them through a webcam, and records attendance automatically with the current date and time.

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/001Rshubham/QR-Code-Based-Student-Attendance-System.git
```

## 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

```bash
cd QR-Code-Based-Student-Attendance-System
```

## 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# ▶️ How to Use

## Step 1: Create a Student List

Inside the **student_lists** folder, create a text file for each **class or subject**.

Example:

```text
student_lists/
├── Python.txt
├── Java.txt
├── DataScience.txt
└── ClassA.txt
```

Each file should contain **one student name per line**.

Example (`Python.txt`)

```text
Rahul Sharma
Priya Patil
Amit Kumar
Sneha Joshi
Rohan Singh
```

---

## Step 2: Generate QR Codes

Run the QR Generator.

```bash
python qr_generator.py
```

When prompted, enter the student list filename.

Example

```text
📁 Enter (LIKE-class1.txt):
Python.txt
```

The generated QR codes will be stored in:

```text
qrcodes/
└── Python/
    ├── Rahul Sharma.png
    ├── Priya Patil.png
    ├── Amit Kumar.png
    └── ...
```

---

## Step 3: Scan Student QR Codes

Run the scanner.

```bash
python scan_attendance.py
```

The webcam will open.

Each student scans their QR code.

The system will:

- Detect the QR code
- Read Student Name
- Read Class/Subject Name
- Record Date & Time
- Prevent duplicate scans during the current session

Attendance will be stored inside:

```text
attendance_records/
└── Python_2026-07-14.csv
```

---

## Step 4: Open the Attendance Dashboard

Run the Flask application.

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Using the dashboard you can:

- 📋 View attendance
- 📥 Download attendance CSV files
- 🗑 Clear attendance records
